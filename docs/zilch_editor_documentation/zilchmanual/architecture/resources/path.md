The [Path](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/code_reference/class_reference/path.md) resource is used as a base for the [LevelPath](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/gameplay/levelpath.md) component. 


## Using a Path

The Path resource on its own has no accessible functions. Instead a LevelPath component should be attached to an object, which will make its unique instance of a path which can then be accessed and modified. See the [LevelPath](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation.md) page for more information.
