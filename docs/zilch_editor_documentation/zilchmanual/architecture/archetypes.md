An Archetype [ Resource ](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/architecture/resources.md) is the serialized definition of a Cog (Game Object Composition) which can be used as a template from which to create new cogs from. The core benefit of Archetypes is that any changes made to the Archetype affect each object created from the Archetype. These objects are called **instances** of the Archetype.
