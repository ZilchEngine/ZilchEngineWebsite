The [TorqueEffect](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/code_reference/class_reference/torqueeffect.md) component applies a torque to an object. Torque is also known as angular force.

Torque is applied about an axis with a strength. The resultant force will cause an object to spin about the axis according to the [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule ). By default, torque is applied in the local space of the object.

 #  Application Modes
Torque is only assumed to be used as a [RigidBody](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/physics/physicseffectsandregions/rigidbody.md) effect. This will cause the object to twist about its center of mass. Other application modes are undefined.
