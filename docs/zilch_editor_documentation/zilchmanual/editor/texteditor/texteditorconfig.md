The Zilch Engine provides you with various ways to customize your code editing experience. These customizations range from preset color schemes to changing the functionality of code editing features.

 # Accessing the Text Editor Config
The `TextEditorConfig` component which manages the editable properties of the Zilch Engine text editor is located on the `EditorConfig` object. This is a special object that is created and managed by the core engine. The `EditorConfig` can be accessed in the following way:

 - With the `Level Window` focused
  - Use the hotkey `Shift + E`
