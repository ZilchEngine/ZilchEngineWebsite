 # The Projects Tab

The Projects tab lets the user create new projects and manage existing ones.

 ## New Project

 ### Project Templates
The project templates are `EMPTY 2D PROJECT` and `EMPTY 3D PROJECT`. Both options will result in an empty Zilch project, but with a few differences in settings.

**New Project Default Settings by Template**

| **Setting**  | **Description** | `EMPTY 2D PROJECT` | `EMPTY 3D PROJECT` |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| PhysicsSpace **Mode2D** | Default behavior for collision resolution | `true` | `false` |
| EditorCamera | Settings of editor camera | 2D (orthographic projection, etc.) | 3D (perspective projection, etc.) |
| DefaultCamera | Settings of the camera that is placed by default in each new level | 2D (orthographic projection, etc.) | 3D (perspective projection, etc.) |
| GridDraw **Axis** | Perpendicular axis to the grid plane | `ZAxis` | `YAxis` |

NOTE: Even if a game starts with the 2D template, it can still become a 3D game or even just use 3D elements.  The template you choose simply specifies the default settings for certain properties.

 ### Name and Location
The Name  of the project is required, but the `TAGS field` is optional.  Both are ways of labeling a project so that it can be searched for in the [Recent Projects](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/editor/launcher.md#recent-projects) subtab.  TAGS  will parse a comma-delimited list of strings, where each string becomes a seperate tag: `<tag1>, <tag2>, <tag3>`

 ### Version
The version can be selected from here as long as it's installed from the [Builds tab](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/editor/launcher.md#the-builds-tab).  Optionally, the latest version can be installed by selecting `the version drop-down  > INSTALL LATEST`

 ## Recent Projects


![ZilchLauncher_ProjectsTab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchFiles/master/doc_files/47866.gif)


Moving on to projects previously created, by clicking the **Recent** button you will bring up the Recent Projects subtab.
The recent projects tab a list of the latest Zilch projects that were worked on.  The maximum number of recent projects shown can be changed through the `MAX RECENT PROJECTS` in the [Settings tab](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/editor/launcher.md#the-settings-tab).

 ### Project Tiles
Each recent project will show up as a project tile, showing information relating to that project.  There is an option to remove a tile from the project list, by clicking on an X on the bottom right of the tile.

 ### Search Bar
The search bar can be used to filter the project list, by name and by tag.

 ### In a Project Tile
Once a project tile is selected, more information and a launch option are displayed.  Clicking on the ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchFiles/master/doc_files/47881.png) button will open the directory of the project.  The version selector works the same as the one in the [New subtab](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/editor/launcher.md#new-project).

 ## Browse Projects
Clicking on the **Browse** subtab will open the systems default explorer to manually find and locate a project.  The expected file type of a project is `.zeroproj`.

 ## The Builds Tab


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchFiles/master/doc_files/47891.png)


The Builds tab features a list of Zilch Engine build versions that are currently installed or available for download.  A new build can be installed by clicking on it's version in the left pane, and finding the ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchFiles/master/doc_files/47885.png) button.  Alternatively, an installed version will have a ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchFiles/master/doc_files/47889.png) button for uninstalling.

(WARNING)**Why Choose a Different Build?**
While it may seem unnecessary initially, having access to earlier builds of the engine can be beneficial.  Changing the version between project launches can make a project unplayable, unlaunchable, or otherwise broken.  One solution is to fix the project as the latest engine version changes, but time may not permit this.  The quicker more reliable solution is to retain the version of the last working build.

WARNING:
Any number of builds can be installed and stored at once, but each build installed takes up around `300` MB of disk space.

 ## The Settings Tab
