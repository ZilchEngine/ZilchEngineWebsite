Materials define the various texture mappings and shaders that will be applied to a model that has the material.

 # [ Materials Overview ](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/graphics/materials/materials_overview.md)
Material blocks represent various rendering models and shaders of a material. The [deferred renderer](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/graphics/renderer/deferred_renderer.md) in Zilch should be fed with PBR-based materials composed of specific components.

 # [Textures](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/graphics/materials/textures.md)
Textures are the external data that materials apply to a model.

 # [Shaders](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/graphics/materials/shaders.md)
Shaders are generally short linear math programs that modify texture data before they are rendered.

 # [Physically Based Rendering](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/zilch_editor_documentation/zilchmanual/graphics/physically_based_rendering.md)
Physically-based rendering (PBR) is a rendering technique that aims to represent how the surface of objects appear in real life.
