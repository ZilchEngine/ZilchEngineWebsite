Modelling a cloud of dust with individual game objects is prohibitively expensive. We use particle systems to simulate physics for effects such as dust, explosions, and fire.

 # [Sprite Particle System](particles/sprite_particle_system.md)
This is the core of sprite based particle systems.

 # [Emitters](particles/emitters.md)
Emit Particles based on either standard or custom meshes.

 # [Linear Particle Animator](particles/linear_particle_animator.md)
Apply forces to particles.

 # [Particle Color Animator](particles/particle_color_animator.md)
Color particles based on time and velocity
