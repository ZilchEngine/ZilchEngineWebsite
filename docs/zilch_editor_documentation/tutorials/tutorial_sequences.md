If you are new to game engines and programming you've come to the right place! We have prepared a series of tutorials to introduce you to everything you'll need to start making your own games.

These lectures are designed to be followed in order and they'll provide step-by-step instructions to build simple projects for you to get familiar with the tools and concepts you'll need later.

So, without further ado, let's get started!
