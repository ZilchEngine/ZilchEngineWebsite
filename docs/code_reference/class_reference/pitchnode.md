 #  Properties


---  
 #  Pitch : [real](../nada_base_types/real.md)

> The pitch adjustment applied to the node's input. A value of 0 will not affect the sound's pitch; 1 will raise the pitch by an octave and speed up the sound, and -1 will lower the sound by an octave and slow it down. Large pitch changes will likely affect the quality of the sound.
> ```TS:Nada
> var Pitch : Real


---  
 #  Semitones : [real](../nada_base_types/real.md)

> The pitch adjustment, in semitones (or half-steps), applied to the node's input. A value of 0 will not affect the sound's pitch; 12 will raise the pitch by an octave and speed up the sound, and -12 will lower the sound by an octave and slow it down. Large pitch changes will likely affect the quality of the sound.
