Before diving into Zilch Source, it is important to become familiar with Zilch itself as a game engine. Please visit [getting_started](https://github.com/ZilchEngine/ZilchDocs/blob/master/getting_started.md).

Requirements
------------
- Windows 7 or higher
- Visual Studio 2010 (2012/2013/2015 will work but require 2010 compiler)

  - Express versions will work with Zilch and can be used Commercially
  - http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9709969 (2010 ISO)

- Tortoise HG

Pulling the ZilchEngine repository is all that is required to start building Zilch (all dependencies are included).

When we start-up Zilch on Windows, we use a .cmd file because the locations of libraries may be redefined by environmental variables. We've tried to keep it as simple as possible: downloading the Zilch source and opening it via the .cmd should bring you to Visual Studio, and you can immediately build and run from there. You should set Win32Editor as the start-up project. Win32Editor implements the classic WinMain (and on other platforms we would have a similar system). The WinMain performs some Windows specific tasks such as setting up the crash handler or Visual Studio Output window, and then creates the engine by calling Startup. The Startup function is mostly generic and will probably be re-factored for different platforms, however currently the different systems that we initialize are very dependent on which Os you are running on so we left it there (Joysticks, Touch System, etc). Startup is also responsible for creating the Editor or running a game if this is a standalone exported project. The Editor currently has a lot of functionality on it and over time we'll be replacing parts of it with script, and separating a lot of different functionality out into separable modules.
